Near them, on the sand,  \n Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,  \n And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,  \n Tell that its sculptor well those passions read  \n Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,  \n The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;  \n And on the pedestal, these words appear:  \n My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;  \n Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!  \n Nothing beside remains. Round the decay  \n Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare  \n The lone and level sands stretch far away.”","tag":"Percy Bysshe Shelley, Ozymandias"},{"body":"And yet, though invariably happiest elsewhere,\n there is within me a feeling for old Salem, which, in lack of a\n better phrase, I must be content to call affection. The sentiment\n is probably assignable to the deep and aged roots which\n my family has struck into the soil. It is now nearly two centuries\n and a quarter since the original Briton, the earliest emigrant\n of my name, made his appearance in the wild and forest-bordered\n settlement, which has since become a city. And here his descendants\n have been born and died, and have mingled their\n earthy substance with the soil; until no small portion of it must\n necessarily be akin to the mortal frame wherewith, for a little\n while, I walk the streets. In part, therefore, the attachment\n which I speak of is the mere sensuous sympathy of dust for\n dust.","tag":"Nathaniel Hawthorne, The Scarlet Letter I: The Custom-House"},{"body":"I used to watch and study this patriarchal personage with, I\n think, livelier curiosity, than any other form of humanity there\n presented to my notice. He was, in truth, a rare phenomenon;\n so perfect, in one point of view; so shallow, so delusive, so impalpable,\n such an absolute nonentity, in every other. My conclusion\n was that he had no soul, no heart, no mind; nothing, as I\n have already said, but instincts: and yet, withal, so cunningly\n had the few materials of his character been put together, that\n there was no painful perception of deficiency, but, on my part,\n an entire contentment with what I found in him.","tag":"Nathaniel Hawthorne, The Scarlet Letter I: The Custom-House"},{"body":"The somewhat dim coal-fire has an essential influence in producing\n the effect which I would describe. It throws its unobtrusive\n tinge throughout the room, with a faint ruddiness upon\n the walls and ceiling, and a reflected gleam from the polish of the\n furniture. This warmer light mingles itself with the cold spirituality\n of the moonbeams, and communicates, as it were, a heart\n and sensibilities of human tenderness to the forms which fancy\n summons up. It converts them from snow-images into men and\n women. Glancing at the looking-glass, we behold—deep within its haunted verge—the smouldering glow of the half-extinguished\n anthracite, the white moonbeams on the floor, and a repetition\n of all the gleam and shadow of the picture, with one remove\n further from the actual, and nearer to the imaginative. Then,\n at such an hour, and with this scene before him, if a man, sitting\n all alone, cannot dream strange things, and make them look like\n truth, he need never try to write romances.","tag":"Nathaniel Hawthorne, The Scarlet Letter I: The Custom-House"},{"body":"The vulgar, who, in those dreary old times, were always contributing\n a grotesque horror to what interested their imaginations,\n had a story about the scarlet letter which we might readily work\n up into a terrific legend. They averred, that the symbol was\n not mere scarlet cloth, tinged in an earthly dye-pot, but was\n red-hot with infernal fire, and could be seen glowing all alight,\n whenever Hester Prynne walked abroad in the night-time. And\n we must needs say, it seared Hester’s bosom so deeply, that\n perhaps there was more truth in the rumor than our modern\n incredulity may be inclined to admit.","tag":"Nathaniel Hawthorne, The Scarlet Letter V: Hester at Her Needle"}],"greek":[{"body":"αἱ συμφοραὶ τῶν ἀνθρώπων ἄρχουσι καὶ οὐκὶ ὥνθρωποι τῶν συμφορέων","tag":"Herodotus, Inquiries VII.49.3"},{"body":"Κακὸν κακοῦ οὐχ ἅπτεται","tag":"Aesop, Proverbs 30"},{"body":"οὐ τοῖς ἀ̄θύμοις ἡ τύχη ξυλλαμβάνει","tag":"Sophocles, frag. 927"},{"body":"οἱ γὰρ πολλοὶ τὴν μὲν ἁλήθειαν ἁγνοοῦσιν, πρὸς δὲ τὴν δόξαν ἀποβλέουσιν.","tag":"Isocrates, To Demonicus 17"},{"body":"ὅν γὰρ θεοὶ φιλοῦσιν, ἀποθνήσει νέος","tag":"Menander, Sententiae 425"},{"body":"ὡς οὐ δικαίως θάνατον ἔχθουσιν βροτοί,\n ὅσπερ μέγιστον ῥύμα τῶν πολλῶν κακῶν ","tag":"Aeschylus, frag. 353"},{"body":"ἄνθρωπός ἑστι πνεῦμα καὶ σκιὰ̄ μόνον.","tag":"Sophocles, frag. 13"}],"latin":[{"body":"Disertissime Romuli nepotum,\n quot sunt quotque fuere, Marce Tulli,\n quotque post aliis erunt in annis,\n gratias tibi maximas Catullus\n agit pessimus omnium poeta,\n tanto pessimus omnium poeta,\n quanto tu optimus omnium patronus.","tag":"Catullus 49"},{"body":"hostis habet muros; ruit alto a culmine Troia.\n sat patriae Priamoque datum: si Pergama dextra\n defendi possent, etiam hac defensa fuissent.\n sacra suosque tibi commendat Troia penatis;\n hos cape fatorum comites, his moenia quaere\n magna pererrato statues quae denique ponto.'\n sic ait et manibus vittas Vestamque potentem\n aeternumque adytis effert penetralibus ignem.","tag":"Vergil, Aeneid II.290-297"},{"body":"Tu ne quaesieris (scire nefas) quem mihi, quem tibi \n finem di dederint, Leuconoe, nec Babylonios \n temptaris numeros.
